# 🍛 Bangladeshi Food Dataset

### Overview

The **Bangladeshi Food Dataset (BFD-58)** is a curated image collection designed to advance research in **food recognition**, **computer vision**, and **cultural AI**.
It contains **7,500+ high-quality images** across **58 traditional Bangladeshi food categories**, including iconic dishes such as *Biriyani*, *Khichuri*, *Hilsha Fish*, *Roshogolla*, and *Pitha*.

This dataset aims to fill a major gap in current food recognition resources, which are predominantly Western-centric (e.g., Food-101, FoodX-251). BFD-58 provides a culturally rich, geographically diverse dataset representing authentic Bangladeshi cuisine — an underrepresented domain in global AI research.

### ✨ Key Features

* **58 distinct food categories** covering main dishes, sweets, snacks, and beverages
* **7,500+ labeled images** collected from diverse real-world sources (homes, restaurants, markets, and online platforms)
* **High-quality manual verification** to ensure accurate labels and clean data
* **Balanced representation** of urban and regional foods
* **Ready for ML pipelines** — organized in a `class_name/` folder structure compatible with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras

### 🧠 Motivation

Most large-scale food datasets (e.g., Food-101, ISIA Food-500) overrepresent Western dishes and underrepresent South Asian cuisines. This limits the performance and fairness of computer vision models across cultures.
**BFD-58** was created to bridge that gap by providing a high-quality, publicly available dataset centered on Bangladeshi culinary diversity — supporting fairer, more inclusive food recognition systems.

---

### 🚀 Usage

You can use this dataset for:

* Food image **classification** and **fine-grained recognition**
* **Transfer learning** and **PEFT** (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) experiments
* **Cross-cultural dataset comparison** (e.g., training on Food-101 and evaluating on BFD-58)
* **AI fairness** and **representation** studies in computer vision

Example (PyTorch):

```python
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

data_dir = "path/to/BFD-58"
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

dataset = datasets.ImageFolder(root=data_dir, transform=transform)
```
